## Advent of Code, 2021

Return to rust, baby! After a stint in f#, I want to go through this in Rust again.

### Notable files

`src/bin/dayx.rs` is my template file.
`src/bin/day0.rs` is a previous year's problem using the template
to make sure that it works as expected.

Todo: file that uses memoization.

Todo: file that uses regex that's only compiled once.
